    <h2>2003–2008: Career Beginnings</h2>
    <p>
        Kendrick Lamar started his career while attending Centennial High School, adopting the stage name K.Dot. He gained attention for his freestyling and battle rapping, leading to his first mixtape, Youngest Head Nigga in Charge (2004). This project caught the interest of Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) founder Anthony "Top Dawg" Tiffith, who signed Lamar in 2005. Lamar formed the hip hop supergroup Black Hippy with TDE labelmates Jay Rock, Ab-Soul, and Schoolboy Q.

His mixtape Overly Dedicated (2010) peaked at number 72 on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.
